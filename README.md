# Python Programming

This is a sports based project with python programming.

My ultimate vision is to create an application or bot that will update me on my favorite sports teams schedule.

At the moment, I had the idea of creating a discord bot and expanding on that. With the help of a bot, I can learn working with multiple files, creating cleaner code, learn python programming, work with APIs, and a host of other things I don't know that I don't know. 

This code is basically copy and paste from a youtube video, but I think its the best place to start at, now I begin to understand how and why it works, what makes it work, different packages, and how to do the things I want it to do. 

It is up and running successfully. Total time working so far 1.5 hours.
