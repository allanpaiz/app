# Python Programming

This is a sports based project with python programming.

My ultimate vision is to create an application or bot that will update me on my favorite sports teams schedule.

At the moment, I had the idea of creating a discord bot and expanding on that. With the help of a bot, I can learn working with multiple files, creating cleaner code, learn python programming, work with APIs, and a host of other things I don't know that I don't know. 

This code is basically copy and paste from a youtube video, but I think its the best place to start at, now I begin to understand how and why it works, what makes it work, different packages, and how to do the things I want it to do. 

It is up and running successfully. Total time working so far 1.5 hours.

Finally got to working on this again, I'm going to be working on this more consistently, I may not make as much progress as I have today, but I'm happy with babysteps at the moment.

I finally learned how to use an API!! While this is basically copy paste code, ITS THE FIRST TIME I DID IT! Lets gooo.

With that, I'm learning how to manipulate Json files, so that I can get the information that I want. Loops are still a mind twist for me, but I love that feeling when I finally get the result I want.

Below is my stopping point, These are the keys for the 6 games google displays, 4 past games, and 2 future games. I want to work specifically with the future games for the moment.
